# Stone Wall Project
## 1. Preparation:
* Install node in command line: `brew install node` ([Reference](https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac))
* Install yarn in command line: `brew install yarn` ([Reference](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable))
## 2. Clone and run the project
* Click the green button "Clone or Download". Copy the url in that block. 
* Go back to terminal, go to the target directory, type `git clone (the url)` ** there're spaces after "git" and "clone".
* cd into the project directory, cd into `client` directory, this is the react front end directory.
* Run `yarn install`
* Run `yarn start` to open the project from default browser. This will open the App.js file (client => src => App.js)
* When closing the port, go to terminal and hit control(^) + C.
